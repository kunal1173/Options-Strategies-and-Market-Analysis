Task 3.1: Two-step Binomial Model for American Put Option

Given:
- Current stock price (S0) = ₹150
- Expected annual increase or decrease in stock price (u) = 10%
- Expected annual decrease in stock price (d) = -10%
- Risk-free interest rate (r) = 6%
- Strike price (K) = ₹170
- Time periods (t) = 2 years

Step 1: Calculating u and d
- u = 1.10
- d = 0.90

Step 2: Calculating the risk-neutral probability (p)
- p = (e^(r * Δt) - d) / (u - d)
- p = (e^(0.06 * 1) - 0.90) / (1.10 - 0.90)
- p ≈ (1.0618 - 0.90) / 0.20
- p ≈ 0.1618 / 0.20
- p ≈ 0.809

Step 3: Constructing the binomial tree for stock prices
-  Constructing a binomial tree with two time steps and calculate the stock prices at each node.

Step 4: Calculating option payoffs at each node
- At each node, we'll calculate the option payoff using the formula: Payoff = max(0, K - S)
  - At the final nodes:
    - Stock price at node (up, up) = S0 * u^2 = ₹150 * (1.10)^2 ≈ ₹181.50
    - Stock price at node (up, down) = S0 * u * d = ₹150 * 1.10 * 0.90 ≈ ₹148.50
    - Stock price at node (down, up) = S0 * u * d = ₹150 * 1.10 * 0.90 ≈ ₹148.50
    - Stock price at node (down, down) = S0 * d^2 = ₹150 * (0.90)^2 ≈ ₹135.00
  - Option payoff at each final node:
    - Payoff (up, up) = max(0, K - S) = max(0, ₹170 - ₹181.50) = ₹0
    - Payoff (up, down) = max(0, K - S) = max(0, ₹170 - ₹148.50) = ₹21.50
    - Payoff (down, up) = max(0, K - S) = max(0, ₹170 - ₹148.50) = ₹21.50
    - Payoff (down, down) = max(0, K - S) = max(0, ₹170 - ₹135.00) = ₹35.00

Step 5: Backtracking through the tree to calculate option prices
- Starting from the second time step, and backtracking through the tree to calculate the option prices at each node, considering early exercise for American options.
- At each node, the option price is the discounted expected value of the option payoffs in the next period.
  - Option price at node (up, up) = e^(-r * Δt) * [p * Option payoff (up, up) + (1 - p) * Option payoff (up, down)] = e^(-0.06 * 1) * [0.809 * ₹0 + (1 - 0.809) * ₹21.50] ≈ ₹11.35
  - Option price at node (up, down) = e^(-r * Δt) * [p * Option payoff (down, up) + (1 - p) * Option payoff (down, down)] = e^(-0.06 * 1) * [0.809 * ₹21.50 + (1 - 0.809) * ₹35.00] ≈ ₹24.29
  - Option price at node (down, up) = e^(-r * Δt) * [p * Option payoff (down, up) + (1 - p) * Option payoff (down, down)] = e^(-0.06 * 1) * [0.809 * ₹21.50 + (1 - 0.809) * ₹35.00] ≈ ₹24.29

Step 6: Determine early exercise decision for American options
- For American options,  compare the option payoff with the option price calculated in the previous step and choose the higher value at each node.

Step 7: Finding the option premium
- The option premium is the option price at the initial node.
  - Option premium ≈ ₹24.29

Final Answer:
The price of the 2-year American put option on the company's stock with a strike price of ₹170 is approximately ₹24.29.
